# youtube_page_reactjs
Youtube webapp in react.js

### About this project
This is a Youtube page webapp. You can search and run Youtube videos on it. I learned this from an online course ["Tutorial: Intro To React"](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux). In this project, I learn about basic react.js, axios, promise and Youtube API. I used create-react-app and install Bootstrap 4.0.0 with npm instead of the course project starter.
